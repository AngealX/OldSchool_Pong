# OldSchool_Pong
In this project I imported the turtle library with python to create an old school classic pong.
<br>
Within the code I made plenty of notes (pretty much on each line or each "section" of code) so that it would be easy to follow along on what I did and how I was thinking about doing it. Feel free to update the game in your own way!!!

# Update
I am planning on adding sounds for the beginning of the game and during the game. I also will be adding sounds for when the ball hits the poles and when either one of the players makes a score and then has an end-song theme (one for a winner and one for a tie). So, stay tuned :)
